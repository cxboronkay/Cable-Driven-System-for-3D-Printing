Please see the powerpoint "Large scale 3d printing with CDPR" for instructional information and electronics schematics before use!

Design files and necessary programs for running the CDPR machine can be found here, as well as simple example G-code programs. Assembly is uploaded as a SolidWorks assembly with all necessary parts. All 3D printed parts are also uploaded as STEPs and STLs, as well as one STEP version of the assembly as a whole.
